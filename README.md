# lilo
Small little text editor


## Use

lilo.py **filename**

## Dependencies

### python3. 
    If you are in macOS, don't use the python shipped with the OS, that's usually python2

## Pendings

1. CTRL, ALT keys detection
2. Map save functionality with CTRL-S and quit with CTRL-Q (now is directly the letter q, so good luck trying to write 'I quit') 
3. Create empty buffer and associate it with file when save if the user invokes **lilo** without parameters
4. Menu, status and more key-bindings
5. Highlight code (huge)
